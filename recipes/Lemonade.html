    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Lemonade is a refreshing, sweet-tart beverage made primarily from freshly squeezed lemon juice, water, and sugar. Loved for its zesty flavor and cooling effect, it is a popular drink during hot summer days. The balance of sourness from the lemons and sweetness from the sugar makes it both invigorating and hydrating. Often served chilled with ice cubes and garnished with lemon slices or mint leaves, lemonade is not only a thirst-quencher but also a simple, timeless classic enjoyed worldwide.</p>
